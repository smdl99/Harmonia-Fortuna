        <h2>2. General information and mandatory information</h2>
        <h3>Data protection</h3>
        <p>
          The operators of this website and its pages take the protection of
          your personal data very seriously. Hence, we handle your personal data
          as confidential information and in compliance with the statutory data
          protection regulations and this Data Protection Declaration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whenever you use this website, a variety of personal information will
          be collected. Personal data comprises data that can be used to
          personally identify you. This Data Protection Declaration explains
          which data we collect as well as the purposes we use this data for. It
          also explains how, and for which purpose the information is collected.
          We herewith advise you that the transmission of data via the Internet
          (i.e. through e-mail communications) may be prone to security gaps. It
          is not possible to completely protect data against third-party access.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the responsible party (referred to as the
          &apos;controller&apos; in the GDPR) The data processing controller on
          this website is:
        </p>
        <h3>HF Management LTD</h3>
        <p>
          Suite C, Level 7, World Trust Tower, 50 Stanley Street, Central, Hong
          Kong
          <br />
          E-mail: <a href="mailto:info@hf8.ch">info@hf8.ch</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          The controller is the natural person or legal entity that
          single-handedly or jointly with others makes decisions as to the
          purposes of and resources for the processing of personal data (e.g.
          names, e-mail addresses, etc.).
        </p>
        <h3>Storage duration</h3>
        <p>
          Unless a more specific storage period has been specified in this
          privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the
          purpose for which it was collected no longer applies. If you assert a
          justified request for deletion or revoke your consent to data
          processing, your data will be deleted, unless we have other legally
          permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g. tax or
          commercial law retention periods); in the latter case, the deletion
          will take place after these reasons cease to apply.
        </p>
        <h3>Information on data transfer to the USA</h3>
        <p>
          Our website uses, in particular, tools from companies based in the
          USA. When these tools are active, your personal information may be
          transferred to the US servers of these companies. We must point out
          that the USA is not a safe third country within the meaning of EU data
          protection law. US companies are required to release personal data to
          security authorities without you as the data subject being able to
          take legal action against this. The possibility cannot therefore be
          excluded that US authorities (e.g. secret services) may process,
          evaluate and permanently store your data on US servers for monitoring
          purposes. We have no influence over these processing activities.
        </p>
        <h3>Revocation of your consent to the processing of data</h3>
        <p>

          to your express consent. You can also revoke at any time any consent
          you have already given us. This shall be without prejudice to the
          lawfulness of any data collection that occurred prior to your
          revocation.

          object to direct advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)
        </h3>
        <p>
          IN THE EVENT THAT DATA ARE PROCESSED ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6 SECT. 1
          LIT. E OR F GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO AT ANY TIME OBJECT TO THE
          PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA BASED ON GROUNDS ARISING FROM YOUR
          UNIQUE SITUATION. THIS ALSO APPLIES TO ANY PROFILING BASED ON THESE
          PROVISIONS. TO DETERMINE THE LEGAL BASIS, ON WHICH ANY PROCESSING OF
          DATA IS BASED, PLEASE CONSULT THIS DATA PROTECTION DECLARATION. IF YOU
          LOG AN OBJECTION, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL
          DATA, UNLESS WE ARE IN A POSITION TO PRESENT COMPELLING PROTECTION
          WORTHY GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING OF YOUR DATA, THAT OUTWEIGH YOUR
          INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OR IF THE PURPOSE OF THE PROCESSING IS
          THE CLAIMING, EXERCISING OR DEFENCE OF LEGAL ENTITLEMENTS (OBJECTION
          PURSUANT TO ART. 21 SECT. 1 GDPR).
        </p>

          ADVERTISING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO AT ANY TIME OBJECT TO THE
          PROCESSING OF YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA FOR THE PURPOSES OF SUCH
          ADVERTISING. THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS
          AFFILIATED WITH SUCH DIRECT ADVERTISING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL
          DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING
          PURPOSES (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21 SECT. 2 GDPR).
        </p>
        <h3>Right to log a complaint with the competent supervisory agency</h3>
        <p>
          In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects are entitled to
          log a complaint with a supervisory agency, in particular in the member
          state where they usually maintain their domicile, place of work or at
          the place where the alleged violation occurred. The right to log a
          complaint is in effect regardless of any other administrative or court
          proceedings available as legal recourses.

          transfer of the data to another controller, this will be done only if
          it is technically feasible.
        </p>
        <h3>SSL and/or TLS encryption</h3>
        <p>
          For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential
          content, such as purchase orders or inquiries you submit to us as the
          website operator, this website uses either an SSL or a TLS encryption
          program. You can recognize an encrypted connection by checking whether
          the address line of the browser switches from &apos;http://&apos; to
          &apos;https://&apos; and also by the appearance of the lock icon in
          the browser line.If the SSL or TLS encryption is activated, data you
          transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.
        </p>
        <h3>Encrypted payment transactions on this website</h3>
        <p>
          If you are under an obligation to share your payment information (e.g.
          account number if you give us the authority to debit your bank
          account) with us after you have entered into a fee-based contract with
          us, this information is required to process payments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Payment transactions using common modes of paying (Visa/MasterCard,
          debit to your bank account) are processed exclusively via encrypted
          SSL or TLS connections. You can recognize an encrypted connection by
          checking whether the address line of the browser switches from
          &apos;http://&apos; to &apos;https://&apos; and also by the appearance
          of the lock icon in the browser line.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the communication with us is encrypted, third parties will not be
          able to read the payment information you share with us.
        </p>
        <h3>Information about, rectification and eradication of data</h3>
        <p>
          Within the scope of the applicable statutory provisions, you have the
          right to at any time demand information about your archived personal
          data, their source and recipients as well as the purpose of the
          processing of your data. You may also have a right to have your data
          rectified or eradicated. If you have questions about this subject
          matter or any other questions about personal data, please do not
          hesitate to contact us at any time at the address provided in section
          &apos;Information Required by Law.&apos;
        </p>
        <h3>Right to demand processing restrictions</h3>
        <p>
          You have the right to demand the imposition of restrictions as far as
          the processing of your personal data is concerned. To do so, you may
          contact us at any time at the address provided in section
          &apos;Information Required by Law.&apos; The right to demand
          restriction of processing applies in the following cases:
        </p>
        <p>
          In the event that you should dispute the correctness of your data
          archived by us, we will usually need some time to verify this claim.
          During the time that this investigation is ongoing, you have the right
          to demand that we restrict the processing of your personal data.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the processing of your personal data was/is conducted in an
          unlawful manner, you have the option to demand the restriction of the
          processing of your data in lieu of demanding the eradication of this
          data.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we do not need your personal data any longer and you need it to
          exercise, defend or claim legal entitlements, you have the right to
          demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead
          of its eradication.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have raised an objection pursuant to Art. 21 Sect. 1 GDPR, your
          rights and our rights will have to be weighed against each other. As
          long as it has not been determined whose interests prevail, you have
          the right to demand a restriction of the processing of your personal
          data.

        <p>
          If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these
          data - with the exception of their archiving - may be processed only
          subject to your consent or to claim, exercise or defend legal
          entitlements or to protect the rights of other natural persons or
          legal entities or for important public interest reasons cited by the
          European Union or a member state of the EU.
        </p>
        <h3>Rejection of unsolicited e-mails</h3>
        <p>
          We herewith object to the use of contact information published in
          conjunction with the mandatory information to be provided in section
          &apos;Information Required by Law&apos; to send us promotional and

          take legal action in the event of the unsolicited sending of
          promotional information, for instance via SPAM messages.

        </p>
        <p>
          Cookies have a variety of functions. Many cookies are technically
          essential since certain website functions would not work in the

          Cookies, which are required for the performance of electronic
          communication transactions (required cookies) or for the provision of
          certain functions you want to use (functional cookies, e.g. for the
          shopping cart function) or those that are necessary for the
          optimization of the website (e.g. cookies that provide measurable
          insights into the web audience), shall be stored on the basis of Art.
          6 Sect. 1 lit. f GDPR, unless a different legal basis is cited. The

          The information you have entered into the contact form shall remain
          with us until you ask us to eradicate the data, revoke your consent to
          the archiving of data or if the purpose for which the information is
          being archived no longer exists (e.g. after we have concluded our
          response to your inquiry). This shall be without prejudice to any
          mandatory legal provisions - in particular retention periods.
        </p>

        <p>
          These data are processed on the basis of Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. b GDPR if
          your inquiry is related to the fulfillment of a contract or is
          required for the performance of pre-contractual measures. In all other
          cases, the data are processed on the basis of our legitimate interest
          in the effective handling of inquiries submitted to us (Art. 6 Sect. 1
          lit. f GDPR) or on the basis of your consent (Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. a
          GDPR) if it has been obtained.
        </p>
        <p>
          The data sent by you to us via contact requests remain with us until
          you request us to delete, revoke your consent to the storage or the
          purpose for the data storage lapses (e.g. after completion of your

          user data Google has in its possession (e.g. location data and
          interests; target group targeting). As the website operator, we can
          analyze these data quantitatively, for instance by analyzing which
          search terms resulted in the display of our ads and how many ads led
          to respective clicks.

        <h3>Facebook Pixel</h3>
        <p>
          To measure conversion rates, this website uses the visitor activity

          Limited, Google Building Gordon House, 4 Barrow St, Dublin, D04 E5W5,
          Ireland on our website. This service helps our website to prevent spam
          and block bots. The program recognizes whether the user is a real
          person or a bot in order to protect our website from cyber attacks.

        <p>
          ReCaptcha v3 works with an algorithm that collects and analyzes a
          user&apos;s interactions with a website to create a score. The final
          score indicates whether the activity is suspicious. This version aims
          to improve the user experience by eliminating the need for questions
          and creating a seamless user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following data is processed by reCaptcha: Mouse and keyboard
          behavior (every action you perform with the mouse or keyboard),
          information about your operating system, date and language settings of
          your browser, the Google cookies placed on the website, your answers
          to the question fields on the website, referrer URL (via which
          website/advertising media you came to this website), CSS information,
          all JavaScript objects, screen resolution and the plug-ins installed
          in your browser. The algorithm also recognizes IP addresses that were
          previously recognized as human by cookies.

          Internet, your personal data will be collected and processed by the
          provider of the respective conference tool and by us. The conferencing
          tools collect all information that you provide/access to use the tools
          (email address and/or your phone number). Furthermore, the conference
          tools process the duration of the conference, start and end (time) of
          participation in the conference, number of participants and
          other&apos;context information&apos; related to the communication
          process (metadata).

          Furthermore, the provider of the tool processes all the technical data
          required for the processing of the online communication. This
          includes, in particular, IP addresses, MAC addresses, device IDs,
          device type, operating system type and version, client version, camera
          type, microphone or loudspeaker and the type of connection.

          Should content be exchanged, uploaded or otherwise made available
          within the tool, it is also stored on the servers of the tool
          provider. Such content includes, but is not limited to, cloud
          recordings, chat/ instant messages, voicemail uploaded photos and
          videos, files, whiteboards and other information shared while using
          the service.

          Please note that we do not have complete influence on the data
          processing procedures of the tools used. Our possibilities are largely
          determined by the corporate policy of the respective provider. Further
          information on data processing by the conference tools can be found in
          the data protection declarations of the tools used, and which we have

          existing contractual partners or to offer certain services to our
          customers (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR). Furthermore, the
          use of the tools serves to generally simplify and accelerate
          communication with us or our company (legitimate interest in the
          meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR). Insofar as consent has been
          requested, the tools in question will be used on the basis of this

          Data collected directly by us via the video and conference tools will
          be deleted from our systems immediately after you request us to delete
          it, revoke your consent to storage, or the reason for storing the data
          no longer applies. Stored cookies remain on your end device until you
          delete them. Mandatory legal retention periods remain unaffected.
